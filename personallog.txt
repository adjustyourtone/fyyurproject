- Issue migrating DB. KeyError: 'migrate' when running flask   db init
    - Must instantiate a "Migrate" object that takes app and db as parameters. 

- Need to create Show and Artist models? Artist is already created.
    - data1(L.136) Missing Venue columns: "seeking_talent(boolean)" and "seeking_description (string)". 'artists' is a relationship to 'Artist'

    - data(L.298) Missing Artist column: seeking_venue(boolean) and seeking_description(string)

    -A Show model would need some sort of show ID, an artist_id that's linked to Artist.id and a venue_id linked to Venue.id. (L.153) includes a "start_time" field. Think of it as a 'Fact Table'
    class Show:
    tablename = Show
    id = INT primarykey
    venue_id = INT foreignkey=('Venue.id')not null
    artist_id = INT foreignkey="('Arist.id') not null
    start_time = DB.DateTime, not null

        Relationships: 
            Artists and Venues have no direct relationship. All relationships should be pooled from the Show table.

- Created and migrated DB relationships.
